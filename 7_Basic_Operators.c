// Arithmetic Operators
// +	Adds two operands.
// −	Subtracts second operand from the first.
// *	Multiplies both operands.
// /	Divides numerator by de-numerator.
// %	Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division.
// ++	Increment operator increases the integer value by one.
// --	Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one.

// Relational Operators
// ==	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true.
// !=	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.
// >	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.
// <	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.
// >=	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.
// <=	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.

// Logical Operators
// &&	Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
// ||	Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
// !	Called Logical NOT Operator. It is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make it false.

// Assignment Operators
// =	Simple assignment operator. Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand
// +=	Add AND assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assign the result to the left operand.
// -=	Subtract AND assignment operator. It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
// *=	Multiply AND assignment operator. It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
// /=	Divide AND assignment operator. It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
// %=	Modulus AND assignment operator. It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
// <<=	Left shift AND assignment operator.
// >>=	Right shift AND assignment operator.
// &=	Bitwise AND assignment operator.
// ^=	Bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator.
// |=	Bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator.
